However, there are certain situations or specific applications where complex numbers might be used to represent image data.</p><p>One common application where complex numbers come into play is in the field of signal processing, particularly when dealing with Fourier Transforms. The Fourier Transform is a mathematical operation that decomposes a signal (which can be an image) into its constituent frequencies. In this context, the use of complex numbers helps capture both the amplitude and phase information of different frequency components.</p><p>Here’s a simplified explanation:</p><ol><li><strong>Real and Imaginary Parts:</strong> In the context of the Fourier Transform, the real part of a complex number represents the amplitude or intensity of a particular frequency component, while the imaginary part represents the phase information.</li><li><strong>Phase Information:</strong> The phase information is crucial in understanding the spatial relationships and patterns in an image. It tells us about the arrangement of pixels and the transitions between light and dark areas.</li><li><strong>Complex Images in Fourier Space:</strong> When you perform a Fourier Transform on an image, you get a complex-valued representation. The complex numbers in this representation encode both the amplitude and phase of different spatial frequencies present in the image.</li></ol><p>It’s worth noting that in most practical image processing applications, you’ll work with the standard pixel values between 0 and 255, as you mentioned. The use of complex numbers in the Fourier Transform is more of an intermediate step in certain types of analysis rather than the standard representation of an image.</p><h2 id="why-use-Fourier-transform"><a href="#why-use-Fourier-transform" class="headerlink" title="why use Fourier transform"></a>why use Fourier transform</h2><p>Fourier Transform can be applied to the image to convert it into the frequency domain. The transformed image can then be manipulated in the frequency domain to achieve encryption. Encryption techniques may involve modifying the amplitude or phase information of specific frequency components. This process can make it more challenging for unauthorized users to understand or reconstruct the original image without the proper decryption key.</p><h2 id="Transient-Image-but-we-are-not-going-to-use-this"><a href="#Transient-Image-but-we-are-not-going-to-use-this" class="headerlink" title="Transient Image(but we are not going to use this)"></a>Transient Image(but we are not going to use this)</h2><p><strong>Regular Imaging:</strong> Imagine taking a photo with a regular camera. It captures a single moment in time, like a snapshot. But what if you wanted to see how things change over a very short time, like a blink of an eye?</p><p><strong>Transient Imaging to the Rescue:</strong> Transient imaging is like having a special camera that can capture not just one moment but a sequence of very quick moments, almost like a super-fast video. This helps us see how light moves and changes in a scene over a tiny amount of time.</p><p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Time-of-Flight Magic:</strong> Transient imaging often uses a trick called “time-of-flight.” This means the camera measures how long it takes for light to travel to objects and bounce back. By knowing the time, we can figure out distances.</li><li><strong>Ultrafast Speeds:</strong> Imagine taking pictures so fast that you can catch even the quickest movements of light. Transient imaging uses super-fast cameras and laser pulses to do just that.</li></ol><p><strong>Cool Things It Can Do:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Depth Perception:</strong> It helps us figure out how far away things are in a scene.</li><li><strong>Seeing Through Stuff:</strong> Transient imaging can sometimes see through objects by capturing light that bounces off hidden things.</li></ul><p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine you’re in a room with your eyes closed, and someone quickly turns on and off a flashlight. Regular imaging is like taking a photo with your eyes closed – you won’t see the flashlight. But if you could open your eyes and close them super quickly, like in a sequence, you’d “see” the light turning on and off. That’s a bit like what transient imaging does with light in a scene.</p><p>So, transient imaging is like having a super-speedy camera that can reveal the hidden dance of light, helping us understand things happening in the blink of an eye!</p><p>Yes, exactly! Transient imaging involves using a camera that can capture a sequence of images extremely quickly, much faster than traditional cameras. These rapid images provide information about how light changes and moves through a scene over a very short period, allowing for unique insights into dynamic processes, depth perception, and even the ability to see through certain objects. So, you can think of transient imaging as a super-fast camera capturing the quick and subtle changes in the way light interacts with the environment.</p><h2 id="PSF"><a href="#PSF" class="headerlink" title="PSF"></a>PSF</h2><p><strong>Imagine a Flashlight:</strong></p><ul><li>Think of a small, bright flashlight shining in the dark. In a perfect world, the light from the flashlight would make a perfect, tiny dot on a wall.</li></ul><p><strong>Real World isn’t Perfect:</strong></p><ul><li>In the real world, when you shine that flashlight through a lens or take a picture with a camera, the light doesn’t make a perfect dot. It spreads out a bit, like a soft glow around the dot.</li></ul><p><strong>Point Spread Function (PSF):</strong></p><ul><li>The Point Spread Function (PSF) is like a map that shows how that tiny dot of light spreads out when it goes through a lens or an optical system. It tells us how the light from a point source turns into a bigger shape in the final image.</li></ul><p><strong>Why Does it Matter?</strong></p><ul><li>Understanding the PSF helps us deal with blurriness or fuzziness in images. When we take a photo, we might lose some sharpness because of how the light spreads. Knowing the PSF helps us fix or account for that blurriness.</li></ul><p><strong>In Simple Terms:</strong></p><ul><li>PSF is like the fingerprint of blurriness in pictures. It shows us how a perfect dot of light becomes a little fuzzy spot in the real world of cameras and lenses. Understanding it helps us make images clearer and better!</li></ul><h4 id="WHY-IT-SPREADS-OUT-IN-REAL-LIFE"><a href="#WHY-IT-SPREADS-OUT-IN-REAL-LIFE" class="headerlink" title="WHY IT SPREADS OUT IN  REAL LIFE?"></a>WHY IT SPREADS OUT IN  REAL LIFE?</h4><p>The spreading out of light, as described by the Point Spread Function (PSF), is a result of various optical phenomena and imperfections in real-world optical systems. Here are a few reasons why light tends to spread out or blur in practical optical systems:</p><ol><li><strong>Lens Imperfections:</strong><ul><li>Lenses, which are crucial components in optical systems, are not perfect. They can have imperfections such as spherical aberrations, chromatic aberrations, and distortions. These imperfections cause light rays to converge or diverge slightly, leading to a spread of light.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Diffraction:</strong><ul><li>Diffraction is a phenomenon that occurs when light encounters an obstruction or passes through an aperture. It causes light to spread out as it bends around edges. The size and shape of the aperture or lens affect the degree of diffraction.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Aperture Size:</strong><ul><li>The size of the aperture through which light passes influences the spreading of light. A larger aperture allows more light to enter but can lead to more pronounced diffraction effects, contributing to blurring.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Wave Nature of Light:</strong><ul><li>Light exhibits wave-like behavior. The wave nature of light contributes to phenomena like interference and diffraction, which can result in the spreading out of light as it travels through an optical system.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Aberrations:</strong><ul><li>Various aberrations, including coma and astigmatism, can distort the shape of an image. These aberrations cause light rays from a single point to converge at slightly different locations, contributing to the spread of light.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Understanding and characterizing the PSF help scientists, engineers, and researchers in the fields of optics and image processing to account for and mitigate the blurring effects introduced by these optical phenomena. Techniques like deconvolution can be applied to reverse or reduce the impact of the PSF, improving the sharpness and clarity of images.</p><h2 id="convolve-PSF-with-an-image"><a href="#convolve-PSF-with-an-image" class="headerlink" title="convolve PSF with an image"></a>convolve PSF with an image</h2><p>When you convolve an image with its Point Spread Function (PSF), the output is a new image that simulates the blurring or spreading effects that the optical system would introduce. In other words, the convolution with the PSF models how a sharp, idealized image would appear after going through a real-world optical system.</p><p>When we say “convolve with PSF” in the context of image processing, we are referring to the process of convolving an image with its Point Spread Function (PSF). This operation is a fundamental step in understanding and modeling the blurring introduced by an optical system.</p><p>Here’s a simplified explanation of the process:</p><ol><li><strong>Image and PSF:</strong><ul><li>An image captured by an optical system is affected by various factors like lens imperfections, diffraction, and aberrations. The PSF represents how light from a point source is spread out in the image due to these factors.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Convolution:</strong><ul><li>Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third. In the context of image processing, convolution with the PSF is performed by sliding the PSF over each pixel of the image and calculating the weighted sum of pixel values based on the PSF at each position.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Blurring Effect:</strong><ul><li>The convolution operation effectively simulates the blurring effect caused by the optical system. The result of the convolution is a new image that incorporates the blurring characteristics of the PSF.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Deconvolution:</strong><ul><li>In some cases, deconvolution is applied to reverse the blurring effect introduced by the convolution. Deconvolution techniques attempt to estimate and undo the impact of the PSF, restoring the image closer to its original state.</li></ul></li></ol><p>The convolution with the PSF is crucial for tasks such as image restoration, deblurring, and understanding the behavior of imaging systems. It is particularly relevant in situations where achieving a sharp and accurate representation of the original scene is essential, such as in medical imaging or astronomy.</p><p>[TOC]</p>]]></content>

However, most of the problems that are discussed, can be solved using other known algorithms like <em>Dynamic Programming</em> or <em>Greedy Algorithms</em> in logarithmic, linear, linear-logarithmic time complexity in order of input size, and therefore, outshine the backtracking algorithm in every respect (since backtracking algorithms are generally exponential in both time and space). However, a few problems still remain, that only have backtracking algorithms to solve them until now. </p><h3 id="linkedList-VS-ArrayList"><a href="#linkedList-VS-ArrayList" class="headerlink" title="linkedList VS.

However, the difference lies in the order of retrieving and removing those elements from the <code>Deque</code>.

This means that even if an exception occurred during the division (e.g., division by zero), the elements would have already been removed from the <code>Deque</code>, potentially altering its state.</li><li><strong>Code Block 2:</strong> It directly uses <code>removeLast()</code> to both retrieve and remove the elements. This ensures that the elements are removed from the <code>Deque</code> after the division is performed. If an exception occurred during the division, the <code>Deque</code> would remain unchanged.</li></ul><p>In terms of functionality, both code blocks perform the same division operation. However, Code Block 2 is safer because it preserves the integrity of the <code>Deque</code> even in the presence of exceptions during the division operation.</p><h3 id="347-Top-K-Frequent-Elements"><a href="#347-Top-K-Frequent-Elements" class="headerlink" title="347.

salting"></a>hashing &amp; salting</h3><p>The reason why is a hashing algorithm does not inherently produce a unique string for the same password text each time it’s received. In other words, suppose your password looks like the example above (Password@1234)<em>.</em> Each time the algorithm receives the same input string, it will always produce the same hash string (i.e. 0F1BA603C1A843A3D02D6C5038D8E959). This is not ideal because a hacker can launch a rainbow attack on your database to crack the passwords stored inside.</p><p>Our problem with hashing is fixed with a simple solution: using salt. Salt is a randomly generated, fixed-length value that is designed to be unique with each user password. Salt is appended with the current password string and fed into the hashing system to produce a newly hashed result every time a user creates a password. This means that if you and I have the same password, our hashed strings would be different. And since rainbow table attacks heavily depend on finding a match, it would render them useless.</p><p>The bcrypt library, which creates both salt and hashed data with strong cryptography algorithms backing it, is great for this purpose.</p><h4 id="salt-round"><a href="#salt-round" class="headerlink" title="salt round"></a>salt round</h4><p>When we talk about “hashing salt rounds,” we refer to the process of repeatedly applying the hashing and salting operations a specific number of times. Each iteration is known as a round. The purpose of using multiple rounds is to slow down the hashing process, making it more time-consuming and resource-intensive for an attacker attempting to crack the hashed passwords.</p><h3 id="bcrypt-Hashes"><a href="#bcrypt-Hashes" class="headerlink" title="bcrypt Hashes"></a>bcrypt Hashes</h3><ul><li><p>You can use nvm to upgrade or downgrade your node version.</p><p>go to nvm github, install the script with the command in github</p><p>go to terminal type -&gt;

<code>map</code> to render a list of components, it’s essential to assign a unique identifier to each component. This unique identifier is known as a “key.” The purpose of the key is to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed from the list.

Hooks</h3><ol><li><strong>Only call Hooks at the top level</strong>: Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Always use Hooks at the top level of your React functional component or custom Hook. This ensures that Hooks are called in the same order every time a component renders.</li><li><strong>Only call Hooks from React functions</strong>: You can’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Hooks should only be called from within React function components or custom Hooks.</li></ol><p><a href="https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/usestate-hook-completed-ylxqj">https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/usestate-hook-completed-ylxqj</a></p><p><strong>what’s hook?</strong><br>In React, a Hook is a special function that allows you to “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from functional components. Before the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, state and lifecycle methods were only available in class components. With Hooks, you can use state and other React features in functional components without the need for classes.</p><p>Hooks are functions provided by React that you can use to add state and other React features to your functional components. They allow you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components without changing the component hierarchy.</p><p>Some commonly used React Hooks include:</p><ol><li><code>useState</code>: Allows functional components to use state.</li><li><code>useEffect</code>: Allows functional components to perform side effects (such as data fetching, DOM manipulation) after the component renders.</li><li><code>useContext</code>: Allows functional components to consume context provided by a <code>Context.Provider</code> higher up in the component tree.</li><li><code>useReducer</code>: An alternative to <code>useState</code> for managing more complex state logic with reducers.</li><li><code>useCallback</code> and <code>useMemo</code>: Optimization Hooks for performance optimization by memoizing functions or values to prevent unnecessary re-renders.</li><li><code>useRef</code>: Allows functional components to persist values across renders without causing re-renders.</li></ol>]]></content>

<code>map</code> to render a list of components, it’s essential to assign a unique identifier to each component. This unique identifier is known as a “key.” The purpose of the key is to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed from the list.

Before the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, state and lifecycle methods were only available in class components. With Hooks, you can use state and other React features in functional components without the need for classes.</p><p>Hooks are functions provided by React that you can use to add state and other React features to your functional components. They allow you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components without changing the component hierarchy.</p><p>Some commonly used React Hooks include:</p><ol><li><code>useState</code>: Allows functional components to use state.</li><li><code>useEffect</code>: Allows functional components to perform side effects (such as data fetching, DOM manipulation) after the component renders.</li><li><code>useContext</code>: Allows functional components to consume context provided by a <code>Context.Provider</code> higher up in the component tree.</li><li><code>useReducer</code>: An alternative to <code>useState</code> for managing more complex state logic with reducers.</li><li><code>useCallback</code> and <code>useMemo</code>: Optimization Hooks for performance optimization by memoizing functions or values to prevent unnecessary re-renders.</li><li><code>useRef</code>: Allows functional components to persist values across renders without causing re-renders.</li></ol>]]></content>

GUIs serve as the visual interface through which users interact with software, offering intuitive controls and visual feedback. APIs, on the other hand, define the methods and protocols for communication between different software components, allowing seamless integration and interaction. The connection between GUI and API lies in their collaboration: GUIs utilize APIs to access and manipulate underlying functionalities, abstracting away the complexity of implementation details. This integration enables developers to design user-friendly interfaces while leveraging the power and flexibility of underlying systems through standardized interfaces provided by APIs. Thus, GUIs and APIs work in tandem, with APIs serving as the bridge that connects the user-facing interface of the GUI to the underlying functionality of the software system.</p><ul><li><a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a></li></ul><h2 id="POST-MAN"><a href="#POST-MAN" class="headerlink" title="POST MAN"></a>POST MAN</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywxIQ2ZXw4">vedio</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/vdespa/introduction-to-postman-course">course note</a></p><p>Postman is a popular collaboration platform for API development used by developers and teams to simplify the process of building, testing, and managing APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface for sending HTTP requests, testing APIs, and viewing responses in various formats like JSON and XML. Postman allows users to create and organize collections of API requests, share them with team members, and collaborate on API development projects. It also offers features for automating tests, monitoring APIs, and documenting APIs with detailed descriptions and examples. Overall, Postman streamlines the API development process and enhances productivity for developers and teams.</p><p>post man is not for:</p><ol><li>user interation</li><li>performance testing]</li><li>security testing</li></ol><h3 id="HEADERS"><a href="#HEADERS" class="headerlink" title="HEADERS"></a>HEADERS</h3><p>meta information, some more additional information.</p><p>In the context of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), a header is a part of a request or response sent between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. Headers contain additional information about the data being transmitted, such as metadata or instructions for handling the request or response.</p><p>HTTP headers consist of key-value pairs, where the key represents the header name and the value represents the data associated with that header. There are several types of headers, including:</p><ol><li><strong>Request Headers</strong>: These are sent by the client to provide additional information about the request being made. Common request headers include “User-Agent” (providing information about the client making the request), “Accept” (indicating the media types that the client can understand), and “Authorization” (used for authentication purposes).</li><li><strong>Response Headers</strong>: These are sent by the server in response to a request and provide additional information about the server’s response. Common response headers include “Content-Type” (indicating the media type of the response body), “Content-Length” (specifying the length of the response body in bytes), and “Cache-Control” (providing caching directives).</li></ol><h3 id="initial-value-amp-current-value"><a href="#initial-value-amp-current-value" class="headerlink" title="initial value &amp; current value"></a>initial value &amp; current value</h3><p><img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/environment-editor-v10-22.jpg" alt="Add environment"></p><p>To edit an environment variable, select the variable and change any of the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Variable</strong> - The name of the variable.

By default, XAMPP’s MySQL service binds to port 3306 when started, and it can only do so if another program is not already using it.</p><p>To ascertain whether this is the case, you can click on the <strong>Netstat</strong> button to open up a window with a list of all the ports that are being used on your computer currently. <strong>If port 3306 is in the list when you haven’t started MySQL on XAMPP, this means that another program is using it.</strong></p><p><img src="https://blog.terresquall.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/xampp-netstat-window.gif" alt="XAMPP&#39;s Netstat window">Use the <strong>Netstat</strong> window to check if port 3306 has already been occupied.</p><p>To remedy this, you will need to find the process that is using port 3306 and end the process. In the example above, a process called <strong>mysqld.exe</strong> is using port 3306. To stop it, I will have to use Ctrl + Alt + Delete to open up the <strong>Task Manager</strong>, then find and end the <strong>mysqld.exe</strong> process.</p><p><img src="https://blog.terresquall.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/task-manager.jpg" alt="Task Manager">If your <strong>Task Manager</strong> doesn’t show all the processes, click on <strong>More details</strong> at the bottom of the window to get the full <strong>Task Manager</strong> window.</p><h2 id="“-x2F-“-vs-“-x2F-“"><a href="#“-x2F-“-vs-“-x2F-“" class="headerlink" title="“&#x2F;“ vs. “.&#x2F;“"></a>“&#x2F;“ vs. “.&#x2F;“</h2><p>“&#x2F;“ means it will look into the public static file to look for a certain file</p><p>“.&#x2F;“ means it will go to the current path </p>]]></content>

The “fs” module is a built-in module in Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side applications.</p><p>The “fs” module provides methods and functionality to interact with the file system, allowing you to read from and write to files, create directories, modify file permissions, and perform other file-related operations. It enables you to work with files and directories on your computer or server.</p><p>Here’s an example of how you can use the “fs” module in Node.js to read the contents of a file:</p><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">javascriptCopy codeconst fs = <span class="built_in">require</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;fs&#x27;</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">fs.<span class="title function_">readFile</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;file.txt&#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27;utf8&#x27;</span>, <span class="function">(<span class="params">err, data</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (err) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="variable language_">console</span>.<span class="title function_">error</span>(err);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="variable language_">console</span>.<span class="title function_">log</span>(data);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In the above example, <code>fs.readFile</code> is used to read the contents of the file named “file.txt” in the current directory. The callback function receives any potential error (<code>err</code>) and the file contents (<code>data</code>). If no error occurs, the contents of the file are printed to the console.</p><p>Note that the “fs” module is specific to Node.js and is not available in web browsers, as JavaScript running in a browser has limited access to the local file system for security reasons.</p><h2 id="Synchronous-vs-Asynchronous"><a href="#Synchronous-vs-Asynchronous" class="headerlink" title="Synchronous vs. Asynchronous"></a>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous</h2><p>Node.JS only has one thread and all the users accessing your application are using this thread.</p><ul><li><p>Synchronous code is also called blocking code because a certain operation can only be executed after the one before has finished.</p><p>eg. readFileSync</p></li><li><p>Asynchronous code is non-blocking code. Asynchronous code is a programming paradigm that allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking the execution of the program.

Without it, modern <a href="https://www.koombea.com/blog/keys-to-ultimate-web-design/">web design</a> would be static and boring. JavaScript is a programming language.

Not exactly. <strong>JSON is a data format that is independent of any</strong> <a href="https://www.koombea.com/blog/best-back-end-languages-how-to-choose-the-perfect-one/"><strong>programming language</strong></a><strong>, although it is derived from</strong> <strong>JavaScript</strong>. The bulk of modern programming languages contain code that can generate and parse JSON data. </p><p>A few notes on JSON:</p><ul><li><p>It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data</p></li><li><p>The syntax is self-describing, making it easy for humans to read and understand</p></li><li><p>Typically, JSON is used when data is sent from a server to a web page</p></li></ul><p> JavaScript and JSON are two completely different things. While JSON is derived from JavaScript, the two are not exactly comparable in any way. However, we can compare JSON to JavaScript objects. These two are more closely related, and they offer us a better comparison. </p>]]></content>

String to Integer (atoi)</a></h3><h4 id="overflow-template"><a href="#overflow-template" class="headerlink" title="overflow template"></a>overflow template</h4><p>Medium</p><p>Implement the <code>myAtoi(string s)</code> function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C&#x2F;C++’s <code>atoi</code> function).</p><p>The algorithm for <code>myAtoi(string s)</code> is as follows:</p><ol><li>Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.</li><li>Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is <code>&#39;-&#39;</code> or <code>&#39;+&#39;</code>. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.</li><li>Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.</li><li>Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. <code>&quot;123&quot; -&gt; 123</code>, <code>&quot;0032&quot; -&gt; 32</code>). If no digits were read, then the integer is <code>0</code>. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).</li><li>If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range <code>[-231, 231 - 1]</code>, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than <code>-231</code> should be clamped to <code>-231</code>, and integers greater than <code>231 - 1</code> should be clamped to <code>231 - 1</code>.</li><li>Return the integer as the final result.</li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><ul><li>Only the space character <code>&#39;

The dependencies section of a POM file lists the external libraries (or other modules within the project) that the project needs in order to compile and run successfully.</p><p>Each dependency in the POM file typically includes the following information:</p><ul><li>Group Id: A unique identifier for the group or organization that created the dependency.</li><li>Artifact Id: The name of the dependency.</li><li>Version: The version of the dependency that the project requires.</li><li>Scope: Indicates the scope of the dependency, such as compile, test, runtime, or provided.</li></ul><p>When Maven builds a project, it reads the POM file and downloads all the necessary dependencies from the Maven Central Repository (or other configured repositories), which it uses to compile and run the project. The POM file therefore plays a crucial role in managing the project’s dependencies and ensuring that the correct versions of libraries are used consistently across the project.</p><p>each dependency listed in the dependencies section of a Maven POM file represents an <strong>external library</strong> or module that the project needs in order to compile and run successfully.</p><p>When a Maven project is built, the dependencies are <strong>downloaded from remote repositories</strong> (such as the Maven Central Repository) and stored locally on the developer’s machine, in a directory called the local repository. These dependencies are typically jar files (Java Archive files) that contain compiled Java code and any required resources, such as configuration files or documentation.</p><p>By including dependencies in the POM file, Maven can automatically download and manage the required libraries for the project, making it easier to build and distribute the project to other developers. This also helps ensure that all developers are using the same versions of the dependencies, which can help prevent compatibility issues and simplify debugging.</p><h3 id="Curl-Command"><a href="#Curl-Command" class="headerlink" title="Curl Command"></a>Curl Command</h3><p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/curl-command-in-linux-with-examples/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/curl-command-in-linux-with-examples/</a></p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3>]]></content>

Bucket Sort"></a><font color = "pink"> 4. Bucket Sort</font></h1><p>The process of bucket sort can be understood as a <strong>scatter-gather approach</strong>. Here, elements are first scattered into buckets then the elements in each bucket are sorted. Finally, the elements are gathered in order.</p><p><img src="https://www.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/Bucket_2.png" alt="Bucket Sort Working"></p><p>!!!!!!!</p><ol><li><p>Suppose, the input array is:</p><p><img src="https://www.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/Bucket-sort-0.1_0.png" alt="Bucket Sort Steps">Input array</p><p>Create an array of size 10.

The elements are inserted according to the range of the bucket.</p><p>In our example code, we have buckets each of ranges from 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3,…… (n-1) to n.</p><p>Suppose, an input element is 0.23 is taken. It is multiplied by size &#x3D; 10 (ie. 0.23*10&#x3D;2.3 ). Then, it is converted into an integer (ie. 2.3≈2 ). Finally, .23 is inserted into bucket-2.</p><p><img src="https://www.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/Bucket-sort-0.2_0.png" alt="Bucket Sort Steps"></p><p>Similarly, 0.25 is also inserted into the same bucket. Everytime, the floor value of the floating point number is taken.</p><p>If we take integer numbers as input, we have to divide it by the interval (10 here) to get the floor value.</p><p>Similarly, other elements are inserted into their respective buckets.</p><p><img src="https://www.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/Bucket-sort-0.3_0.png" alt="Bucket Sort Steps"></p></li><li><p>The elements of each bucket are sorted using any of the stable sorting algorithms.

If they have the same height, it compares their <code>k</code> values (<code>a[1]</code> and <code>b[1]</code>) in ascending order. This means that people with the same height will be sorted in ascending order of their <code>k</code> values.</li><li><code>return b[0] - a[0];</code>: If two people have different heights (<code>a[0] != b[0]</code>), it compares their heights in descending order. This means that people with different heights will be sorted in descending order of their heights.</li></ul></li></ol><p>When you subtract <code>b[1]</code> from <code>a[1]</code>, you are calculating the difference between the <code>k</code> values of two people, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. If the result is positive, it means that <code>a[1]</code> is greater than <code>b[1]</code>, indicating that <code>a</code> should come after <code>b</code> in ascending order. Conversely, if the result is negative, it means that <code>a[1]</code> is less than <code>b[1]</code>, indicating that <code>a</code> should come before <code>b</code> in ascending order.</p><p>So, <code>return a[1] - b[1]</code> sorts the array in ascending order of the <code>k</code> values. People with smaller <code>k</code> values (fewer people taller or as tall as them in front) will appear earlier in the sorted array, and people with larger <code>k</code> values (more people taller or as tall as them in front) will appear later in the sorted array. I apologize for any confusion in my previous responses, and thank you for pointing out the error.</p><ol><li>When you add elements with the same <code>p[1]</code> value to the <code>LinkedList</code>, the order in which they were added will be maintained.

It follows the following convention:</p><ul><li><p>If compare(o1, o2) returns a negative value, o1 should come before o2 in the sorted order.</p></li><li><p>If compare(o1, o2) returns zero, o1 and o2 are considered equal in terms of sorting order.</p></li><li><p>If compare(o1, o2) returns a positive value, o1 should come after o2 in the sorted order.</p></li></ul><ol><li>Sorting Examples:<ul><li>You can use <code>Comparator</code> to sort arrays of custom objects based on specific attributes or fields within those objects.</li><li>You can also use it to perform case-insensitive or reverse sorting.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Here’s an example of using <code>Arrays.sort()</code> with a custom <code>Comparator</code>:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">javaCopy codeimport java.util.Arrays;</span><br><span class="line">import java.util.Comparator;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">public class Main &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    public static void main(String[] args) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        String[] fruits = &#123;&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;, &quot;date&quot;&#125;;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        // Sorting the array using a custom Comparator for case-insensitive sorting</span><br><span class="line">        Arrays.sort(fruits, new Comparator&lt;String&gt;() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            @Override</span><br><span class="line">            public int compare(String o1, String o2) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">                return o1.compareToIgnoreCase(o2);</span><br><span class="line">            &#125;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        // Printing the sorted array</span><br><span class="line">        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(fruits));</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="452-Minimum-Number-of-Arrows-to-Burst-Balloons"><a href="#452-Minimum-Number-of-Arrows-to-Burst-Balloons" class="headerlink" title="452.

Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons</a></h3><p>Medium</p><p>There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array <code>points</code> where <code>points[i] = [xstart, xend]</code> denotes a balloon whose <strong>horizontal diameter</strong> stretches between <code>xstart</code> and <code>xend</code>. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.</p><p>Arrows can be shot up <strong>directly vertically</strong> (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with <code>xstart</code> and <code>xend</code> is <strong>burst</strong> by an arrow shot at <code>x</code> if <code>xstart &lt;= x &lt;= xend</code>. There is <strong>no limit</strong> to the number of arrows that can be shot.
